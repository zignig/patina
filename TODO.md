# Stuff TODO.

The intent of Patina is to replace blinky in amaranth. Given (most; LUT > 0x1000), drop a riscv32i control plane CPU. This means that we can put a software state machine upon it.

The base is minimual rust but if you insist on writing C++ or C  that will work aswell. 

There appears to be a lot of stuff to do. My brain has stalled,
so I should probably write a list.

# Gateware


# Firmware

1. write an amaranth_soc <-> hapenny bus bridge.
1. look into the svd exporter (for embeded-hal)
   1. use [https://github.com/embassy-rs/chiptool]
1. clean up the flash lib
   1.  add u32 reader and iterator
   1.  add byte array loader
   1.  write unlock
   1.  address start offset and size guardrails
1. reset on spi boot broken
1. rework the bootloader to timeout on serial and load from flash


# TO-DONE

These are not TODO these are TODONE.

1. fix print! and println! , rework.
1. Write the flash image generator [working]
   1. a page of config  (256 bytes)
   2. 1st word length of program. ( after this page)
   3. second word is address of the data block...
1. auto generate bootloader
1. move the command line into patina/cli.py
1.  move the logging builder into patina/logging.py
1. Rewrite the simple fabric to a single component
